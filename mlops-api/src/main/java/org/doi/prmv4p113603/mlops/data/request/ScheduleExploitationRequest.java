     * In principle that inner class is OK for this kind of request structure.
     * It's a common and clean design choice in the context of DTOs that are:
     *
     * - Only used inside a specific request structure;
     * - Logically scoped to that parent class (e.g., ScheduleExploitationRequest.RunInput);
     * - Not reused elsewhere.
     *
     * For now, it is only meaningful within the context of this request payload and
     * avoids cluttering its package with tiny, one-use classes.
