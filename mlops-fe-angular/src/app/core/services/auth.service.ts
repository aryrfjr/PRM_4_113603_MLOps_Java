/* 
 * This class defines a custom authentication service.
 * 
 * NOTE: In Angular, a service is a core building block that is used to 
 *       define reusable logic not related to the UI and also for state management. 
 *       It is often a Singleton.
 * 
 * NOTE: Recalling that singleton is a design pattern used in software engineering 
 *       to ensure that only one instance of a class exists throughout the entire 
 *       lifecycle of an application, and that this instance is globally accessible.
 * 
 * NOTE: In Angular, @Injectable() is a class decorator that marks a class 
 *       as available to be injected as a dependency into other classes via Angularâ€™s 
 *       Dependency Injection (DI) system. This class AuthService is 
 *       injected into the component LoginComponent (features/login/login.component.ts).
