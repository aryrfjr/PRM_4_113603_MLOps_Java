# PRM_4_113603_MLOps_Java

The repository [PRM_4_113603_MLOps](https://github.com/aryrfjr/PRM_4_113603_MLOps) implements a **Python-based MLOps workflow** for predicting DFT-level chemical bond strengths (-ICOHP values) in metallic glasses, based on the methodology published in Phys. Rev. Materials 4, 113603 (DOI: https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.4.113603; or the [preprint](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/345634787_Chemical_bonding_in_metallic_glasses_from_machine_learning_and_crystal_orbital_Hamilton_population)). It follows a **GETL (Generate + ETL)** approach combining classical molecular dynamics, DFT simulations, and machine learning (Gaussian Process Regression) with SOAP descriptors and bond distances as features.

The pipeline includes **data generation**, **feature engineering**, **model training**, **evaluation**, and **human-in-the-loop active learning**, all orchestrated through **Airflow**, tracked via **MLflow**, and stored in PostgreSQL and local (could be S3-based) stores.

The architecture consists of a set of services (**Streamlit**, **FastAPI**, **Airflow**, and **MLflow**) which coordinate the execution of key components such as the **data explorer and augmenter**, the **human-in-the-loop active learning** process, and **feature extraction** pipeline.

The **FastAPI back-end application** serves as the central controller in this architecture, acting as the communication bridge between the **Streamlit** user interface and the services for **workflow orchestration** and **ML lifecycle** management. It handles all user-triggered actions such as launching **data generation**, triggering **model evaluations**, and updating **experiment states**. By exposing a clean REST interface, it enables modular coordination of the MLOps components, facilitating **interactive workflows**, **experiment reproducibility**, and seamless **integration** with other services like **Airflow** and the **Feature Store Lite**.

For building reliable, scalable, and maintainable systems, Java with **Spring Boot** is clearly superior to Python-based frameworks like **FastAPI** (and generally superior to other alternatives like **Flask** or **Django**). It offers a mature, **enterprise-grade platform** with powerful built-in features for **security**, **configuration**, **monitoring**, **scalability**, **maintainability**, and **integration** with additional services like **Kafka**, **Redis**. Additionally, it and simplifies integration with corporate systems such as **SSO (Single Sign-On)**, **LDAP**, **OAuth2** providers, centralized logging and data governance tools; all of which are essential in enterprise environments. By leveraging **Spring Boot**, the MLOps platform becomes easier to deploy, audit, secure, and scale across teams, making it a stronger fit for long-term use within an organization.

This repository contains a Java-based counterpart for the controller layer ‚Äî replacing **FastAPI** from the original [PRM_4_113603_MLOps](https://github.com/aryrfjr/PRM_4_113603_MLOps) repository ‚Äî that handles all user-triggered interactions (via **Streamlit**) and serves as the central gateway, including endpoints callable by **Airflow** for orchestration.
